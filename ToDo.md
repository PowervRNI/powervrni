## ToDo items/ideas

- \[optimization] leverage API-filtering in applicable `Get-vRNI*` cmdlets, so as to improve performance and flexibility (vs. getting each item until name matches retrieved item, for example)
- \[enhancement] improve `Connect-vRNIServer` experience:  if user specifies credential with username in UPN format (username@mydomain.com), glean domain info from username instead of making the additionally supply `-Domain` value (maybe default to gleaning `Domain` value from username if "@" in name, and change `-Domain` to a switch param for specifying `-UseLocalAuth` or something); would expect most enterprises that are using vRNI to enable LDAP auth, so that is probably a better default than `LOCAL` for domain considerations
- \[enhancement] improve cmdlets that take `-StartTime` / `-EndTime` parameters to take actual `DateTime` objects to improve the user experience (they can pass the more "natural"-in-PowerShell `Get-Date "13 Jun 2017"` as a value, instead of needing to pass a "seconds since 01 Jan 1970" value, or even think about less-legible epoch-based time)
- \[enhancement] add `-WhatIf` support to Set-, Remove-, etc. cmdlets (via `SupportsShouldProcess` directive in `CmdletBinding` and `$PSCmdlet.ShouldProcess()` in the body), and maybe add `ConfirmImpact` of `High` to destructive cmdlets (`Remove-vRNI*`, for example), as described at [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.confirmimpact?view=powershellsdk-1.1.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.confirmimpact?view=powershellsdk-1.1.0)
